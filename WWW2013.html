        <h2>WWW 2013</h2>

<p>This repository contains the resources used in the experiments of the 
paper "<b>Soft Cardinality Constraints on XML Data</b>" for WWW2013.
</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Cardinality constraints capture information about the frequency
with which data items occur in a given context. Our
daily life is defined by restrictions and as XML is the standard
for data exchange and integration, XML data naturally
exhibits cardinality constraints. Semantics is still an
inhibitor to the uptake of XML, and cardinality constraints
can express a lot of semantics important to applications
such as consistency management, data integration, query
optimization, view maintenance and cardinality estimation.
For semi-structured XML data more so than for structured
data, the more semantics of application domains can be captured
the less efficient reasoning about these constraints usually
becomes. In addition, exceptions to strict rules are the
common norm and are therefore difficult to handle by constraints,
which makes them often impractical to exploit. Indeed,
exceptions prove the rule in practice. In this work
we establish a class of cardinality constraints that is able
to deal with both problems. We introduce soft cardinality
constraints which need to be satisfied on average only, and
thus permit violations in a controlled manner. Starting from
a highly expressive but intractable class of soft cardinality
constraints, we establish a fragment that is maximal with
respect to both expressivity and efficiency. More precisely,
we characterize the associated implication problem axiomatically
and develop a low-degree polynomial time decision algorithm.
Any increase in expressivity of our fragment results
in coNP-hardness of the implication problem. Finally, we extensively
test the performance of our algorithm. The performance
evaluation provides first-hand evidence that reasoning
about expressive notions of soft cardinality constraints
is practically efficient and scales well. Our results unleash
cardinality constraints on real-world XML practice, where a
little more semantics makes applications a lot more effective
and where exceptions to common rules frequently occur.</p>


<h3>Files</h3>
<ul>
	<li>"constraints-dataset" folder contains all the sets of constraints used in the decision problem.</li>
    <li>"xmlkeys" is the application to decide the implication problem over XML keys.</li>
    <li>"max-const" is the application to decide the implication problem over Soft-max constraints.</li>
    <li>"xml-constraints-implication-WWW2013.xls" is an excel file with all the results used to generate the corresponding graphics.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: For now we only leave available executable versions for the applications.)</p>


<h3>How to run</h3>
<p>If you want to run our implementations execute the following commands in a console:</p>

<pre>./xmlkeys -f constraints-dataset/tmp.keys -l label</pre> or,
<pre>./max-const -f constraints-dataset/tmp.softmax -l label</pre>

<p>where label is the fixed replacement label. The final response for both applications
is a true if the first constraint (first line) in tmp file is implied by the following constraints;
or false otherwise.</p>

<h4>Other options</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>-t</b> to show the resulting mini-tree</li>
	<li><b>-w</b> to show the resulting witness-graph or cardinality network</li>
	<li><b>-m</b> to show the marking set</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Configuration</h3>
The experiments were executed in a Intel Core i7 2.8 GHz machine, with 4 GB of RAM,
running a 64 bits Linux kernel 2.6.32. We compiled our C++ implementation of the algorithms
using the standard g++ compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection 4.6.3.
