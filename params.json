Also contains an excel \r\n\t\tfile with all the results used to generate the corresponding graphics.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n(Note: For now we only leave available executable versions for the applications.)\r\n\r\n<h3>How to run</h3>\r\nIf you want to run our implementations execute the following commands in a console:\r\n\r\n<pre>./xmlkeys -f dataset/tmp.keys -l label</pre> or,\r\n<pre>./max-const -f dataset/tmp.softmax -l label</pre>\r\n\r\nwhere label is the fixed replacement label. The final response for both applications\r\nis a true if the first constraint (first line) in tmp file is implied by the following constraints;\r\nor false otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nFor further question please do not hesitate to contact us: emir [a dot] munoz [an at] deri [a dot] org\r\n"}
